# Kaggle-Flower-Classification
## Introduction
Welcome to the Petals to the Metal competition! In this competition, youâ€™re challenged to build a machine learning model to classify 104 types of flowers based on their images. In this tutorial notebook, you'll learn how to build an image classifier in Keras and train it on a Tensor Processing Unit (TPU). At the end, you'll have a complete project you can build off of with ideas of your own.

To improve classification accuracy of the model on the test dataset, the following are explored:

* Input image size
* Pretrained model and number of trainable parameters of final model
* Data augmentation
* Regularization techniques
* Use of learning rate schedule
